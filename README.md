# OpenAI-powered CRUD App

This repository contains a Node.js and Express.js application powered by OpenAI APIs, designed for seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with MongoDB integration.

## Features

- Perform CRUD operations using natural language input.
- Simplifies data management by understanding human-readable commands.
- Utilizes Node.js and Express.js for backend functionality.
- Harnesses the power of OpenAI APIs for natural language processing.
- Stores data in MongoDB for efficient data management.

## How it Works

This application allows users to interact with the database using natural language commands. For example, to add a new record to the database, you can simply input a command like: "add John Doe with ID 123". The application will interpret this command, extract relevant information (name and ID), and create a new record in the database accordingly.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- OpenAI APIs
- MongoDB
